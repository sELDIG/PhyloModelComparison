This repository contains code underlying the comparison of 8 eco-evolutionary simulation models and the evaluation of links between eco-evolutionary processes and phylogenetic patterns.  

## Organization  

### Folders  
`trees`
--`uniform_sampling_experiment`: all simulated phylogenetic trees used in the study, with file names in the form *mm_xxxxx.tre* where *mm* is the simulation model abbreviation, and *xxxx* is a unique simulation ID.  
--`empirical`: 16 empirical trees for 8 pairs of sister clades (4 pairs of mammals and 4 pairs of birds)
